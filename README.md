**📊 2. Projects Overview**

**Project 1: Simple Linear Regression**

**Objective:** To establish a linear relationship between a single independent variable (Years of Experience) and a dependent variable (Salary).

**Result:** Achieved high accuracy with a clear "Best Fit Line."

**Project 2: Multiple Linear Regression (Startup Profit)**

**Objective:** Predict the profit of 50 startups using R&D, Administration, and Marketing expenditures.Handling 

**Categories:** Implemented One-Hot Encoding for the "State" column. Used drop_first=True to avoid the Dummy Variable Trap.

**Evaluation:** Achieved an R squared of 0.93. I use Adjusted R-squared to ensure added features (like State) truly contribute to the model.

**Project 3: Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

**Model Performance:** Achieved 93% Accuracy same as  Multiple Linear Regression (93%).

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Tuned the $C$ parameter to 0.01 to create a "Soft Margin," which reduced overfitting and allowed the model to focus on the global trend of the startup data.

**Kernel Analysis:** Tested RBF and Polynomial kernels; however, due to the strictly linear nature of the 50_Startups dataset, the Linear Kernel proved most effective.

**Project 4: Decision Tree Regression (DTR)**

**Model Performance:** Achieved a peak accuracy of 95.8% ($R^2$ Score), officially outperforming both Multiple Linear Regression (93%) and SVR (93%).

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conducted extensive "hypertuning" of the criterion and splitter parameters. Using absolute_error as the criterion proved most effective, as it is more robust to outliers and focused on the median profit of startup groups rather than the mean.

**Structural Insight:** By visualizing the tree, it was confirmed that R&D Spend was selected as the Root Node, identifying it as the single most important predictor of a startup's profit.

**Non-Linear Flexibility:** While SVR struggled with non-linear kernels like RBF, the Decision Tree’s ability to "split" the data into distinct segments allowed it to capture local patterns that linear models missed.
